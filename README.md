# geekoczelnia

This project was developed together with two of my colleagues for the "Introduction to Programming in Python" course. It was created as part of our course assessment using the Flask framework.

Technologies Used:
Flask (Python) – for backend development

HTML, CSS, JavaScript – for frontend development

JSON files – used as a simple database for storing data

The project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts and web development principles, integrating Flask with a basic frontend and JSON-based data storage.
